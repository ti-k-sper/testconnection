			<h2>Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</h2>

			<p>I'm really more an apartment person. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Makes me a … scientist. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>

			<h2>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</h2>

			<p>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I don't want to be rescued.</p>

			<h2>I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.</h2>

			<p>I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</p>
